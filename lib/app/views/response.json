Though she was the first ship to test the new dry dock system, the tough oak hull of “Old Ironsides” had already seen several repairs. To rebuild the ship, woodworkers selected the best wood for each ship part, such as longleaf yellow pine for decking, and white oak for planking. Sawyers and hewers prepared the wood pieces. Carpenters connected the hull pieces with wood treenails, and caulkers sealed the hull with pitch and rope. Metal workers then laid on sheets of copper to protect the bottom of the wooden hull. In 1992, USS <em>Constitution</em> entered Dry Dock 1 for an overhaul to prepare her for third century of service. Despite her many repairs, a significant percentage of her original wood still exists below the water-line. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b361b755-c0af-47c1-857a-03027ded9c57}{218}\" paraid=\"1572627129\"><strong>Image (third column, top and middle row): </strong>In the center of the image, USS <em>Constitution</em>, or “Old Ironsides,” is docked in the Dry Dock at the Charlestown Navy Yard. The three-masted ship’s bow is pointed towards the camera. The three masts extend into the sky, and the sails are down. The left side of the ship’s hull is visible. In the foreground, a chain barrier lines the dry dock. Scaffolding rises from the ground and sits along the ship’s hull. A few workers in white helmets and dark clothes stand on the scaffolding. One of the large navy yard portal cranes sits next to the dry dock on the left side of the image. A building is behind the crane. Another crane rises in the background beyond more structures. A gangway extends from the ship’s deck across the dry dock on the right side of the image. A destroyer is in the background.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{033a7122-7bd5-4165-a16b-f670b0a8adf7}{59}\" paraid=\"1326289412\"><strong>Image credit:</strong> U.S. Navy </p> <p paraeid=\"{033a7122-7bd5-4165-a16b-f670b0a8adf7}{65}\" paraid=\"1771286054\"><strong>Diagram (middle row, first column, left):</strong> A tree with various branches and leaves extends from a patch of grass. A lightly shaded rectangle sits within the tree’s trunk. Above the rectangle is a darker boomerang shape, with one arm extending into a branch.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{033a7122-7bd5-4165-a16b-f670b0a8adf7}{95}\" paraid=\"1413386760\"><strong>Diagram (middle row, first column, right):</strong> The tree trunk from the other diagram is drawn at a diagonal with short pieces of branches sticking out from the sides. Within the trunk is a rectangle. Above the rectangle is a dark three-sided shape with two straight edges connected at a right angle. The third side has a few curves like a boomerang. Below the image and to the right is the label, “Hanging knee.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{033a7122-7bd5-4165-a16b-f670b0a8adf7}{139}\" paraid=\"1634569648\"><strong>Diagram Title:</strong> A ship’s knee.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{033a7122-7bd5-4165-a16b-f670b0a8adf7}{153}\" paraid=\"1791296578\"><strong>Diagram Caption:</strong> Live oak trees yield frames and “knees” that support the ship. Woods that were plentiful in the 1800s are harder to obtain today. Locating wood appropriate to the ship’s original specifications is an ongoing challenge.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{033a7122-7bd5-4165-a16b-f670b0a8adf7}{163}\" paraid=\"1484079704\"><strong>Diagram (middle row, second column, right):</strong> The drawing shows the left side of a ship’s bare hull. It shows the ship's three lower enclosed decks, and the sides of the ship marking the top deck. Along the upper left side of each enclosed deck is a hanging knee from the other drawings. The middle knee, on the second deck up, is dark and solid, while the others are outlined. The illustration also shows vertical lines extending through the middle of the bottom two decks. The first enclosed deck from the top has smaller vertical lines through it, halfway between the left side of the hull and the middle vertical lines. </p> <p paraeid=\"{033a7122-7bd5-4165-a16b-f670b0a8adf7}{239}\" paraid=\"1342108581\"><strong>Image (bottom row, first column, left):</strong> An image of a ship’s hull. A dock and water are in the foreground of the image. A small rectangular wooden boat sits in the water to the left of the dock. Two men stand on the dock to the left of the boat. The man on the left is facing towards the water and is wearing dark suspenders over a light shirt. The man on the right faces the other man and wears a light cap, light shirt, and light pants. Boxes are on the ground dock next to the men. Rope extends along the dock. The hull is oriented, so the bow is towards the front and the left side of the ship is visible as the ship extends beyond the image’s border. Five men stand side by side on the deck and look over the side. At least two of the men are holding onto a piece of rope that is dropped over the side of the ship. The rope is connected to a man standing on posts in the water and working on the ship’s exterior. A sixth man stands on the deck a bit further from the others and is near the mast. Another man stands along the wharf in front of a large building.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a2e43f0c-acb9-4b9d-ab37-c43add85541f}{80}\" paraid=\"194426601\"><strong>Image Title: </strong>Assessing needed repairs (1927) </p> <p paraeid=\"{a2e43f0c-acb9-4b9d-ab37-c43add85541f}{88}\" paraid=\"1228773880\"><strong>Image Credit: </strong>U.S. Navy  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a2e43f0c-acb9-4b9d-ab37-c43add85541f}{96}\" paraid=\"2057630187\"><strong>Image (bottom row, first column, right): </strong>An image of men working on a long plank. In the foreground, one plank extends from the image’s left corner into the background.
